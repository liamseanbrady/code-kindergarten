### Code Kindergarten

### Why Does This Exist?

Simple. I wanted a semi-automated and organized way to practice [**Deliberate Discovery**](http://dannorth.net/2010/08/30/introducing-deliberate-discovery/) for a coding session and be able to track my learning progress over a period of months.

#### Features

- Authentication from scratch. I want to keep gem use to a minimum in building this app to give me the most opportunity to practice TDD.

- Creating a report card. This includes a title, description, grade, session length and whether you want the report card to be visible to other users.

- You can organize your report cards into collections, perhaps based on subject (TDD) language (Haskell).

- You can like other members' report cards, and they can also like yours.

- You can organize your report cards, or the report cards on the 'latest report cards' page by various parameters - language, popular, oldest first (and also mix and match some of these paramters for fine-grained filtering).
